Program Identification & Prompts	The program prints a clear message at the start indicating which calculation it performs (FV, PV, or PMT). It prompts the user only for the inputs required by that specific calculation.	true	5	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Validation: Terminate	Display an error message and terminate the program immediately if: amount of money (PV or FV) is negative; number of periods is negative or zero; present value is greater or equal to future value (only for Recurring Payment calculation).	true	10	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Validation: Default	Notify the user and override with a default value if: annual return rate is negative (default to 5); recurring payment is negative (default to 0); user selects an invalid option for when payments are made (default to 'end').	true	5	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Calculation Correctness	Calculates and displays the correct result for the chosen variant (FV, PV, or PMT), formatted as currency. Edge cases: rate of zero; number of years of zero (if allowed by logic, otherwise handled); zero values for PV/FV/PMT where appropriate; payments made at beginning vs end.	true	30	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Control Flow	Uses if statements in a meaningful way to handle logic and validation. Completing the assignment without using any if statements, or only using them in meaningless/superficial ways, results in no points for this criterion.	true	5	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Style: Function block comments	Each function other than main is annotated with a block comment, as per the course style guidelines.	true	10	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Style: File block comments	The submitted .cpp file provides a file block comment with the author's name and file description.	true	2	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Style: Follows remaining relevant style guidelines	This criterion counts downward from full points with deductions (clipped at 0): code not modularized into functions (SRP violated, up to -10); repeats complex statements/expressions (up to -5); globals (-5); indentation (up to -10); documentation/variable names (up to -5); naming consistency (up to -5); whitespace separation (up to -3); excessively long lines (-1 each); other style issues (TA discretion, up to -5).	true	8	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
AI Critique	Submits ai_planner.cpp and ai_reflection.txt. Reflection must include: (1) two things the AI did well, (2) two potential problems with the AI solution, (3) whether the student would trust the solution, with reasoning.	true	10	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Provides reasonable answers to TA's questions during demo		true	15	Full Marks		0	No Marks							
Extra Credit: Inflation Adjustment (10 pts)	Extra credit option. Prompt the user for an expected inflation rate and adjust the Future Value calculation using the Fisher Equation. Inflation rate can be positive or negative.	true	0	Completed		0	Not Completed							
Extra Credit: Compounding Periods (10 pts)	Extra credit option. Prompt the user for the compounding period (e.g., monthly, annually) and adjust calculations accordingly.	true	0	Completed		0	Not Completed							
Extra Credit: Implement All Options (20 pts)	Extra credit option. Implement all three calculation variants (FV, PV, and PMT) in a single program. The user chooses which calculation to perform at program start.	true	0	Completed		0	Not Completed
