The [Linear Equations](../../assignments/linear-equations), [Financial Planner](../../assignments/financial-planner), and [Dictionary](../../assignments/dictionary) assignments are graded via 1-on-1 demos with TAs. You must sign up for your demos ahead of time.

To sign up for a demo, navigate to **Canvas → Syllabus  → Studios, Office Hours, Demo Bookings** page. Each TA has setup about 20-25 slots for each assignment demo. You can pick slots with any TAs, even different TAs for different assignments, depending on what schedule works for you. If nothing works, email the instruction team and we'll try to accommodate.

- You must schedule exactly **one** demo for each assignment. 
- During your demo, both your **design** and **code** for that assignment will be graded. 
- Do not sign up for separate demos for designs and code. 
- Your demo must be scheduled in the **two weeks following the due date** of the given assignment.
- Do not book demos outside of these date ranges, even if it appears that demo slots are available outside these date ranges.
