<Aside type="danger" title="Understanding and Consistency Requirement">
    <p>
        By submitting this assignment, you confirm that you understand your code
        and can explain all major decisions during your assignment demo. Your
        implementation should generally follow your submitted design.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your design changed during development (which is normal), you are
        expected to briefly note and justify those changes in your submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you cannot explain your code, or if your implementation differs
        significantly from your design without explanation, the assignment may
        receive a zero.
    </p>
