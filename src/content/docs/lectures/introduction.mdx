Welcome to the lecture notes for ENGR 103: Engineering Computation and Algorithmic Thinking. This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of programming and computational thinking using C++. Below is an overview of the topics we will cover throughout the course.

Programming has become an essential skill across all engineering disciplines:

- **Mechanical engineers** use programming to simulate mechanical systems, analyze stress patterns in materials, and automate CAD processes that would be tedious to perform manually. When designing a new vehicle component, an engineer might write code to test how it responds to different forces before creating a physical prototype.
- **Environmental engineers** apply programming to model ecosystem behaviors, analyze large climate datasets, and simulate pollution dispersion patterns. For example, code might be written to predict how contaminants move through groundwater based on soil properties and rainfall patterns.
- **Chemical engineers** leverage programming to simulate reactions, optimize manufacturing processes, and analyze spectroscopic data. When designing a new pharmaceutical production line, programming helps engineers find the most efficient temperature and pressure conditions.
- **Electrical engineers** use code to design circuits, process signals, and develop control systems. Programming microcontrollers enables engineers to create smart devices that respond to their environment in predetermined ways.
- **Nuclear engineers** write programs to model radiation shielding, simulate reactor conditions, or analyze the decay patterns of radioactive materials. This allows testing of safety systems without exposure to actual radiation.
- **Architectural engineers** apply programming to structural analysis, energy modeling, and parametric design. When designing a skyscraper, engineers might write code to calculate how wind forces affect the building at different heights.
- **Robotics engineers** program movement paths, process sensor data, and create decision-making algorithms. Without programming, autonomous robots would simply be static mechanical parts.
- **Biomedical engineers** use code to analyze medical imaging, model physiological systems, and process bioelectric signals from medical devices. A program might help identify patterns in brain activity data that correlate with specific neurological conditions.
- And many others!

As you progress through this course, you'll develop foundational programming skills that can be applied to these fields and many more. The ability to write code that solves engineering problems is increasingly valuable across all disciplines.
