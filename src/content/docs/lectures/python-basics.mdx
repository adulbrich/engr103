## Languages and Programming

Languages are the cornerstone of human communication, allowing us to express ideas, emotions, and instructions. In computing, programming languages serve a parallel role, enabling us to communicate with machines and direct them to perform specific tasks. A solid understanding of programming language fundamentals is essential for anyone entering the field of computer science.

To understand programming languages, we need to explore several key concepts:

1. **Sentence**: A sequence of symbols that carries meaning. In programming, as in spoken languages, sentences represent complete instructions or ideas.
2. **Syntax**: The rules governing how symbols are combined to form valid sentences. Syntax ensures that code is structured correctly, much like grammar in natural languages.
3. **Semantics**: The interpretation or meaning of a sentence. Semantics ensure that instructions convey the intended functionality.
4. **Grammar**: The combination of syntax and semantics, defining valid sentences and their meanings. Grammar provides the framework for writing correct and meaningful code.
5. **Language**: A collection of valid sentences derived from a grammar. In computing, a programming language is a system for writing programs that a computer can execute.

These concepts underpin both human and programming languages. A **programming language** is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can interpret and execute. Just as different spoken languages serve various contexts, programming languages vary in their strengths and applications.

In this course, we use **Python**, a versatile, high-level language widely used in web development, data science, automation, and scientific computing. Python is known for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

:::note[The Story of Python]
Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Guido aimed to design a language that prioritized code readability and simplicity, inspired by the ABC programming language. He named Python after the British comedy series *Monty Python's Flying Circus*, reflecting his playful approach. The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991, introducing core features like functions, modules, and exception handling.

Python has evolved significantly, with major releases like Python 2 (2000) and Python 3 (2008), the latter addressing design flaws and improving consistency. Python's philosophy, captured in the “Zen of Python” (accessible by running `import this` in Python), emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and elegance. Today, Python powers applications from web frameworks like Django to machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, making it a cornerstone of modern software development.

A set of instructions written in a programming language is called a **program** or **software application**. Programs drive nearly every aspect of computing, from web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and productivity tools (e.g., Notepad, Microsoft Word) to operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

:::note[Did You Know?]
Python is the backbone of many high-profile applications. YouTube, built on Python, handles billions of video views daily. Instagram uses Python's Django framework to power its backend. Even NASA employs Python for data analysis in space exploration projects. Python's versatility has made it a favorite across industries, from tech giants to scientific research.

We will focus on terminal-based programs that process textual inputs and outputs. These programs are foundational for understanding how computers interpret and execute instructions, laying the groundwork for more advanced computer science topics.

## Translators

Humans write programs in **high-level** programming languages, which are designed to be readable and expressive. However, computers can only execute instructions in their native **machine language**, a low-level binary code specific to a processor. **Translator programs** bridge this gap by converting high-level code into a form the computer can execute.

### Machine Language

Computers operate using **machine language**, a low-level language composed of binary operation codes tailored to a specific processor. Writing programs directly in machine language is impractical due to its complexity and lack of abstraction. Additionally, machine languages vary across processors, making programs non-portable across different hardware.

### Translator Programs

**Translator programs** convert high-level code into machine-executable instructions. There are two primary types:

1. **Interpreters**: Interpreters translate and execute code line-by-line at runtime. This approach provides immediate feedback, making it ideal for development and debugging. Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Perl are commonly interpreted languages.
2. **Compilers**: Compilers translate an entire program into machine language before execution, producing an executable file. This results in faster runtime performance but requires a separate compilation step. Languages like C++, Go, Rust, and Swift typically use compilers.

:::note[Hybrid Approaches?]
The distinction between interpreters and compilers isn't always clear-cut. Many languages use a hybrid approach, where code is compiled into an intermediate form (bytecode) and then interpreted or executed by a virtual machine. Python, for example, compiles source code into bytecode (stored in `.pyc` files) that is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This hybrid approach balances portability and performance, as seen in languages like Java (with the JVM) and C#.

In this course, we'll use the **Python interpreter** (specifically, CPython, the standard implementation) to execute Python code. Python's interpreted nature allows us to run programs directly without a separate compilation step, simplifying the development process.

### Tradeoffs

Each translator type has tradeoffs:

- **Interpreted Programs**: Easier to debug and test due to immediate feedback, but slower at runtime since translation occurs on-the-fly. Python's interpreter excels in rapid development and prototyping.
- **Compiled Programs**: Faster and more efficient at runtime, as translation is completed beforehand. However, they are less portable, as the executable is tied to a specific architecture.

Understanding translators helps programmers choose the right tools and languages based on project requirements, balancing development speed, performance, and portability.

## Errors

Errors are a natural part of programming, and understanding them is key to writing robust software. Errors fall into three main categories: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.

### Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when code violates the programming language's syntax rules. These errors are detected by the interpreter or compiler before execution, preventing the program from running. In Python, syntax errors are often accompanied by clear error messages pointing to the issue.

**Example**: Forgetting a parenthesis at the end of a `print` statement, e.g., `print("Hello"` instead of `print("Hello"):`.

Use interpreter error messages to locate and fix syntax errors.

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur during program execution, often causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. These errors arise from invalid operations that the interpreter cannot handle.

**Example**: Dividing by zero (`1 / 0`) or accessing an undefined variable.

Python provides exception handling with `try-except` blocks to manage runtime errors gracefully.

### Logic Errors

Logic errors occur when the program runs but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic. These errors are challenging to detect because the program executes without crashing, yet the output is wrong.

**Example**: Using an incorrect formula, such as calculating area as `width + height` instead of `width * height`.

Debugging tools, such as Python's `pdb` module or print statements, help trace and resolve logic errors by inspecting program behavior.

## Python Execution Process

To write a Python program, you create a file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello.py`. This file contains your source code, editable in a text editor like `vim`. For example:

```python
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Unlike compiled languages like C++, Python is interpreted. The Python interpreter (e.g., CPython) reads the source code, translates it to bytecode, and executes it in the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). To run the program, use the `python` command in the terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

This command executes the program and prints `Hello, World!` to the terminal. On some systems, you may need to use `python3` to specify Python 3.

### Updating Your Program

If you modify the source code, such as changing the output to `I love coding!!!`:

```python
# hello.py
print("I love coding!!!")
```

You can rerun the program with `python hello.py`. Since Python is interpreted, there's no separate compilation step—changes are reflected immediately when you execute the program. Always ensure you save the file before running to apply the latest changes.

The **source code** is the program itself in Python, directly executed by the interpreter. Unlike compiled languages, there's no separate executable file, simplifying the development workflow.

## Dissecting Our “Hello, World!” Program

Let's break down the components of our Python “Hello, World!” program:

```python
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

- `print()` is a built-in Python function that outputs text to the terminal (standard output).
- `"Hello, World!"` is a string, a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (single quotes `' '` are also valid). Omitting quotes treats the text as code, causing a syntax error.
- The parentheses `()` are required in Python 3 to call the `print` function. In Python 2, `print` was a statement and didn't require parentheses, but we use Python 3 in this course.
- Unlike C++, Python doesn't require a semicolon at the end of a statement. Python uses whitespace (specifically, newlines) to delimit statements, making code cleaner and more readable.

Python doesn't require a `main` function as the entry point. Code at the top level of the file (not indented) is executed sequentially when the program runs. However, for larger programs, it's common to define a `main` function and call it explicitly using:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This structure mimics C++'s `main` function and is useful for organizing code, especially in scripts that may be imported as modules.

---

If you write invalid code, such as using an undefined function:

```python
prnt("Hello, World!")  # Typo: 'prnt' instead of 'print'
```

Running `python hello.py` produces an error:

```
NameError: name 'prnt' is not defined
```

This indicates that `prnt` is not recognized because Python's standard library defines `print`, not `prnt`. Python's error messages are generally clear, helping you pinpoint issues.

---

We can modify the program by adding another `print` statement:

```diff lang="python"
  print("I love coding!!!")
+ print("I love coding!!!")
```

This produces:

```
I love coding!!!
I love coding!!!
```

If you want output on the same line, you can modify the `print` function's `end` parameter (default is `\n`, a newline):

```python
print("I love coding!!!", end="")
print("I love coding!!!")
```

This outputs:

```
I love coding!!!I love coding!!!
```

The `end=""` argument suppresses the newline, similar to omitting `std::endl` in C++. This demonstrates Python's flexibility in controlling output formatting.

We'll discuss function parameters and arguments in more detail later.
