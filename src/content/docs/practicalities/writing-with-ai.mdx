Please note that AI usage is strictly *against* the course policy. As this is an introduction to programming class, you **need** to understand the concepts and write the code on your own. Using AI to write your assignments while not understanding the code well will make you terrible engineers in the long run. You can use AI the same way you use search engines: to ask questions and help you understand the concepts better.

An Course AI Policy will come later. Refer to the Canvas syllabus in the meantime.

{/* Here's an initial prompt:

```plaintext
Write C++ code to solve this problem:

Given a list of 1 million random integers between 1 and 100,000, find the difference between the smallest and the largest numbers whose digits sum up to 30.
```

Here's a solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <random>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

// Calculate sum of digits for a number
int digitSum(int num) {
    string numStr = to_string(num);
    int sum = 0;
    for (char digit : numStr) {
        sum += (digit - '0');
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Initialize random number generator
    random_device rd;
    mt19937 gen(rd());
    uniform_int_distribution<> dis(1, 100000);

    // Generate 1 million random numbers
    vector<int> numbers;
    numbers.reserve(1000000);
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        numbers.push_back(dis(gen));
    }

    // Find min and max numbers with digit sum 30
    int min_num = INT_MAX;
    int max_num = INT_MIN;
    
    for (int num : numbers) {
        if (digitSum(num) == 30) {
            min_num = min(min_num, num);
            max_num = max(max_num, num);
        }
    }

    // Calculate and display result
    if (min_num == INT_MAX || max_num == INT_MIN) {
        std::cout << "No numbers found with digit sum of 30" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Difference between largest and smallest numbers with digit sum 30: " 
             << max_num - min_num << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Largest: " << max_num << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Smallest: " << min_num << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
``` */}
