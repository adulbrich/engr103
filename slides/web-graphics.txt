The relationship between power, frequency, and voltage depends on the architecture.

Example: An Intel Core i9-13900K has 8 performance cores, each capable of running a full program independently with deep instruction pipelines.

Analogy: A skilled chef who can cook an entire gourmet meal alone—versatile but limited to one dish at a time.

---

We might be able to parallelize `for` loops for example, but not anything conditional.

---

Example: An NVIDIA RTX 4090 has 16,384 CUDA cores, but each one is a tiny ALU, not a full processor—collectively, they churn through teraflops of parallel compute.

Analogy: A fast-food worker flipping burgers—each does one simple task, but thousands together can serve a crowd instantly.
