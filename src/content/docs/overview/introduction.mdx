ENGR 103: Engineering Computation and Algorithmic Thinking introduces fundamental programming concepts through C++, with a focus on solving engineering problems. This course bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application in engineering computation.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into three main components:

1. **Lectures**: Introduce core programming concepts, from basic syntax to complex problem-solving strategies.
2. **Studios**: Hands-on sessions where you'll practice concepts through guided exercises.
3. **Assignments**: Real-world applications that challenge you to solve engineering problems through programming.

## Programming Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. However, you should:
- Be comfortable using a computer
- Have basic algebra skills
- Be willing to learn new technical concepts

## Success Strategies

- **Consistent Practice**: Programming is a skill that improves with practice.
- **Active Participation**: Engage in studios and ask questions during lectures.
- **Early Start**: Begin assignments early to allow time for debugging.
- **Collaboration**: Work with peers while maintaining academic integrity.
- **Resource Utilization**: Take advantage of office hours and course materials.
