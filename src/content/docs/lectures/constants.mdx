In C++, you can use type modifiers to modify a type. These keywords, such as `const` and `constexpr`, can be used wherever a type is declared, but we'll focus on their role in variable declarations.

## Runtime Constants

One such type modifier is `const`. A variable declared with the `const` keyword is a **runtime constant**. This means:

- It must be initialized at the time of declaration (in a single statement).
- Its value cannot be changed after initialization.

To use a type modifier, place it before or after the type being modified. For example:

```cpp
const char my_cool_character = 'D';
```

This declares a variable named `my_cool_character` of type `const char` (i.e., a runtime constant character) and initializes it with the value `'D'`.

Failing to initialize a runtime constant during declaration, or attempting to assign it a new value later, will result in a syntax error, preventing your program from building.

## Compile-Time Constants

Another type modifier is `constexpr`. The `constexpr` keyword marks a variable as a **compile-time constant**. These constants share the same rules as runtime constants:

-	They must be initialized at the time of declaration.
-	Their values cannot be reassigned.

However, compile-time constants have an additional restriction: their initial values must themselves be compile-time constants. A compile-time constant is any value that the compiler can determine during compilation (e.g., literals or values of other `constexpr` variables).

Here's an example of a `constexpr` declaration:

```cpp
constexpr char my_cool_character = 'D';
```

This works because `'D'` is a literal and, therefore, a compile-time constant.

### Difference Between `const` and `constexpr`

While `const` and `constexpr` often overlap, they are not interchangeable in all cases. Consider the following example:

```cpp
char user_input;
std::cin >> user_input;
const char my_cool_character = user_input;
```

Here, `my_cool_character` is a runtime constant initialized with the value of `user_input`. This is valid because const allows initialization with non-constant variables. However, replacing `const` with `constexpr` would cause a syntax error. Why?

1. `constexpr` variables require initialization with a compile-time constant, but `user_input` is not a compile-time constant.
2. Marking `user_input` as `constexpr` char would also fail because:
    - It wouldn't be initialized at declaration.
    - Assigning it a value via `std::cin` involves user input, which is not a compile-time constant.

### Common Use of `constexpr`

`constexpr` variables are particularly useful for replacing literals. For example, instead of hardcoding the value of Ï€ multiple times, you can define it as a `constexpr`:

```cpp
constexpr double pi = 3.14159265;
```

Using such variables enhances code readability, as meaningful variable names are easier to understand than repeated hardcoded values.

## Why Use Constants?

You might wonder why constants are necessary, given their additional rules. While you could replace constants with regular variables, constants serve two primary purposes:

1. Preventing mistakes
2. Improving code readability

### Preventing Mistakes

Constants help eliminate logic errors by converting them into syntax errors. For example, consider the following declaration:

```cpp
double pi = 3.14159265;
```

As a fixed mathematical constant, `pi` should never change. However, with a regular variable, it's possible to *accidentally* reassign its value, leading to a logic error. Logic errors are problematic because they're syntactically valid and often difficult to diagnose. If you instead declare pi as a constant:

```cpp
constexpr double pi = 3.14159265;
```

Any attempt to reassign its value will result in a syntax error. Syntax errors are far easier to detect and resolve during development, making this approach more robust.

### Improving Readability

Constants also improve code readability. When reading code, seeing a variable marked as `const` or `constexpr` reassures you that its value won't change. This eliminates the need to search through the code for potential reassignments. Later in the course, you'll learn about **side effects**--unexpected changes to program state caused by certain operations. Constants prevent such side effects by ensuring their values remain unchanged.

### Advanced Use Cases

Certain advanced features in C++ require `constexpr` variables or other compile-time constants. However, these topics are beyond the scope of this course.
