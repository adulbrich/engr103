## File I/O in C++

Since the last lecture primarily focused on references, this studio introduces File I/O in C++ to expand your learning through exploration.

I/O stands for input/output, describing how programs receive and send data to external sources. Throughout the term, you've already worked with I/O, as the `<iostream>` header provides console I/O (e.g., `std::cin` for input and `std::cout` for output). File I/O extends this concept to reading and writing data to files, enabled by the `<fstream>` header.

The `<fstream>` header introduces two key classes:

- `std::ifstream` the input file stream for reading data from files.
- `std::ofstream` the output file stream for writing data to files.

Both classes are like `std::string`--they are objects created using constructors. Below, we'll explore the syntax and examples for using these classes.

#### Creating File Stream Objects

To create an `std::ifstream` or `std::ofstream` object, use the constructor syntax:

```cpp
<type> <variable_name>(<constructor_arguments>);
```

For example, the following creates an `std::ofstream` object for writing to a file:

```cpp
std::ofstream my_cool_ofstream("my_cool_file.txt", std::ios::app);
```

### `std::ofstream` Objects

The `std::ofstream` constructor accepts:

1. A file path (as a `std::string`) where data will be written.
2. An open mode, a constant specifying how the file should be accessed. 

Two common modes are:

- `std::ios::trunc`: Truncates (erases) the file's contents if it already exists, writing new data from scratch.
- `std::ios::app`: Appends new data to the end of the file without erasing existing content.

If the file doesn't exist, it will be created during this process.

Once an `std::ofstream` object is created, writing to the file is as simple as using the same syntax as `std::cout`:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Writes to the console.
hello_world_stream << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Writes to the file.
```

Here's a complete example program that writes “Hello, World!” to a file:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ofstream hello_world_stream("hello.txt", std::ios::trunc);
    hello_world_stream << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}
```

Execute this program, then check your working directory. A file named `hello.txt` should appear, containing “Hello, World!”.

### `std::ifstream` Objects

The `std::ifstream` constructor accepts a single argument: the path to the file to read. The file must already exist and match the expected format. If the file doesn't exist, the object fails to open.

`std::ifstream` works similarly to `std::cin`. For example:

- The stream extraction operator `>>` reads data word-by-word.
- `std::getline()` reads entire lines.

When created, an `std::ifstream` object points to the start of the file. As you read data, it moves sequentially through the file.

Consider a file `data.txt` with the following content:

```text
5
George Washington
John Adams
Thomas Jefferson
James Madison
James Monroe
```

Here's a program that reads this file and prints names in the format: `<last name>, <first name>`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream my_cool_data_stream("data.txt");

    int num_names;
    my_cool_data_stream >> num_names;

    for (int i = 0; i < num_names; i++) {
        std::string first_name, last_name;
        my_cool_data_stream >> first_name >> last_name;
        std::cout << last_name << ", " << first_name << std::endl;
    }
}
```

If `data.txt` is present in the working directory, this program will output:

```text
Washington, George
Adams, John
Jefferson, Thomas
Madison, James
Monroe, James
```

## Finding the Oldest Student

Suppose you have a file, `student-data.txt`, with the following structure:

```text
<number of students>
<first name> <last name> <age>
<first name> <last name> <age>
...
```

Write a program to:

1. Read data from `student-data.txt` to identify the oldest student.
2. Write the oldest student's name and age to a new file, `oldest-student.txt`, with each detail on a separate line.

In other words:

1. Create an `std::ifstream` object for `student-data.txt`.
2. Use the stream extraction operator to read the data and determine the oldest student.
3. Create an `std::ofstream` object for `oldest-student.txt` in truncate mode.
4. Write the oldest student's details (first name, last name, age) to the file.

You can either use the stream extraction operator `>>` or `std::getline()` to read from a `std::ifstream` object, just as you can with `std::cin`. However, recall that you should avoid mixing both of these mechanisms on a single stream in a single program, unless you're very careful about how you handle whitespace. **For this particular program, it's strongly recommended that you stick with the stream extraction operator.**
