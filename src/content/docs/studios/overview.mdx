Welcome to the studio sessions for ENGR 103! Studios are hands-on, interactive sessions designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lectures through practical application. Each studio focuses on a specific topic and provides a series of exercises and problems to solve. These sessions are crucial for developing your programming skills and understanding the material in depth.

## Studio Topics

1. **Environment Setup and Familiarization**
   - Create an OSU CoE account
   - Set up your development environment
   - Write and run a simple "Hello, World!" application in C++
   - Generate SSH keys for authentication
2. **Git and GitHub**
   - Create a GitHub account
   - Accept assignments on GitHub Classroom
   - Generate and configure SSH keys
   - Clone repositories and manage your code with Git
3. **Expressions, Operators, and Variables**
   - Understand and use different types of expressions and operators
   - Work with variables and data types in C++
4. **Functions**
   - Learn to write and use functions
   - Understand function parameters and return values
   - Refactor code into smaller, reusable functions
5. **If Statements**
   - Implement conditional logic using if statements
   - Understand and use comparison and logical operators
6. **Random Number Generation and Error Handling**
    - Generate random numbers in C++
    - Handle common errors and exceptions
7. **Loops**
   - Use loops to repeat code
   - Understand different types of loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Apply loops to solve problems
8. **Strings**
   - Work with strings in C++
   - Understand string manipulation and functions
9. **Arrays**
