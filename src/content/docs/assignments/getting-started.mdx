This assignment is not a typical programming task, as it does not involve any coding. However, it is categorized under “programming assignments” on Canvas and is weighted accordingly.

The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that you can use the tools we will be using throughout the semester.

The task is a simple questionnaire that you need to complete and submit via GitHub Classroom using the tools discussed in lectures and studios. Start by accepting the assignment on GitHub Classroom through the link provided on Canvas. This will create a repository for you containing the questionnaire. Follow the instructions in the repository's `README.md` file (displayed on the main page of your repository) to complete the questionnaire. Then, submit it by staging, committing, and pushing your changes.

Unlike future assignments, this one does not include a design portion (no formal solution design or unlimited-attempt auto-graded guiding Canvas quiz). It only has a “programming” portion, which involves filling out the questionnaire and pushing your work to your GitHub Classroom repository. This assignment also does not require a demo; it will be graded asynchronously by a random TA. Additionally, it is worth fewer points than future programming assignments. 

You may find the lecture notes on [development environment](../lectures/development-environment.mdx) and [git and GitHub](../lectures/git.mdx), and the content from the first two studios helpful for this assignment.
