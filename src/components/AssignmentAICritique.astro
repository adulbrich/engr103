<p>You will critically evaluate an AI-generated solution or improvement. Your main submission must be your own work.</p>

<p>Choose <strong>one</strong> of the following options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Critique a <em>full solution</em> generated by an AI language model (LLM)
    <ul>
      <li>Generate a solution using an LLM (such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT), save it as <code>ai_{assignmentName}.cpp</code>, and add/commit it <strong>in addition to</strong> your own solution.</li>
      <li>Review the code and identify at least <strong>two things the AI did well</strong> and <strong>two potential problems</strong>. Would you trust the solution in a real project? Why or why not?</li>
      <li>Write a short reflection (<code>ai_reflection.txt</code>) summarizing your critique and commit it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Critique <em>improvements</em> proposed by an LLM for your own solution.
    <ul>
      <li>Submit your own code to an LLM and ask for suggestions (for example by providing the course <a href="../../practicalities/style/#ai-instructions">style guidelines</a>), save it as <code>ai_{assignmentName}.cpp</code>, and add/commit it <strong>in addition to</strong> your own solution.</li>
      <li>Review the proposed changes and discuss at least <strong>two helpful suggestions</strong> and <strong>two potential problems</strong>. Would you trust the changes in a real project? Why or why not?</li>
      <li>Write a short reflection (<code>ai_reflection.txt</code>) summarizing your critique and commit it. Be specific about what you asked and the answers you received.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  {explanation && <li>
    Use an LLM to help you <em>understand the current codebase</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>Ask targeted questions of an LLM to get summaries, explanations, or pseudocode for repository files, functions, or components. Save your prompts and the answers received in <code>ai_explanation.txt</code> and commit it.</li>
      <li>Review the GenAI output and identify at least <strong>two things the model did explain well</strong> and <strong>two things that were not so clear</strong>. Would you trust the explanation in a real project? Why or why not?</li>
      <li>Write a short reflection (<code>ai_reflection.txt</code>) summarizing your critique and commit it. Be specific about what you asked and the answers you received.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>}
</ol>

<p>Your reflection must address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two things the AI did well, with examples.</li>
  <li>Two potential problems or unclear items, with examples.</li>
  <li>Would you trust this AI-generated code/explanation in a real project? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Add and commit the code or explanation and your reflection to your GitHub Classroom repository.</p>
