## Expressions and Operators

Below are example problems demonstrating how to convert mathematical expressions into C++ expressions. Note that there may be multiple valid solutions for each problem. Make sure you understand the examples before attempting the remaining three problems.

You may write your solutions on paper or in any text document.

:::note[Example Problem 1]
Convert the following mathematical expression into a C++ expression:

<Latex formula="x^2 + 3x - 7" inline={false}/>

```text title="Solution 1"
pow(x, 2) + 3 * x - 7
```

```text title="Solution 2"
x * x + 3 * x - 7
```
:::

:::note[Example Problem 2]
Convert the following mathematical expression into a C++ expression:

<Latex formula="\frac{\ln(x+5)}{x^y + z}" inline={false}/>

```text title="Solution"
log(x + 5) / (pow(x, y) + z)
```
:::

Review the provided examples carefully and ensure you account for operator precedence and truncation issues when writing your solutions. Use parentheses as needed for clarity and correctness.

### Problem 1

Convert the following mathematical expression into a C++ expression:

<Latex formula="\frac{x^4 + 3y^3 - 1}{2x^2 + z - 13}" inline={false}/>

If you compute <Latex formula="\frac{1}{2}"/> directly, ensure you avoid truncation by using `1.0 / 2` instead of `1 / 2`.

### Problem 2

Convert the following mathematical expression into a C++ expression:

<Latex formula="\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{x} + 3} \div y" inline={false}/>

<Latex formula="\sqrt[3]{y}"/> can be written as <Latex formula="y^{1/3}"/> using `pow(y, 1.0 / 3)`. Similarly, <Latex formula="\sqrt{x}"/> can be expressed as <Latex formula="x^{1/2}"/> using `pow(x, 1.0 / 2)`.

### Problem 3

Convert the following mathematical expression into a C++ expression:

<Latex formula="\lfloor \ln(x^2) \rfloor" inline={false}/>

<Latex formula="\lfloor \cdot \rfloor"/> is the floor operator, which rounds a value down to the nearest integer. If the input is already an integer, the output will remain the same. The `cmath` library provides the floor function for this purpose. For example, `floor(x / 2)` divides `x` by `2` and rounds the result down. Similarly, the `ceil` function in `cmath` performs the ceiling operation (rounding up to the nearest integer).

To compute the natural logarithm <Latex formula="\ln"/>, use the `log` function. For instance, `log(5)` in C++ is equivalent to <Latex formula="\ln(5)"/>.

## Variables 

A variable represents a fixed location in memory where data of a fixed, specified type is stored. Below are example problems involving the conversion of mathematical equations into corresponding C++ variable initializations. There may be more than one valid solution for each problem. Ensure you understand the examples before attempting the provided problems.

Assumptions:

- The `cmath` library is already included.
- Use the `int` type for variables that are guaranteed to hold integer values. Use the `double` type for all other variables.

You may write your solutions on paper or in any text document.

:::note[Example Problem 1]
Convert the following mathematical equations into a series of C++ variable initializations:

<Latex formula="\begin{align*} x &= 5 \\ y &= x^3 + 7 \\ z &= \ln(y) \end{align*}" inline={false}/>

```cpp title="Solution"
int x = 5;
int y = pow(x, 3) + 7;
double z = log(y);
```
:::

:::note[Example Problem 2]
Convert the following mathematical equations into a series of C++ variable initializations:


<Latex formula="\begin{align*} a &= 5.3 \\ b &= \lfloor a \rfloor \\ c &= \sqrt[b]{a} \end{align*}" inline={false}/>

```cpp title="Solution 1"
double a = 5.3;
int b = floor(a);
double c = pow(a, 1.0 / b);
```

```cpp title="Solution 2"
double a = 5.3;
int b = a; // Implicit truncation by coercion
double c = pow(a, 1.0 / b);
```
:::

### Problem 1

Convert the following mathematical equations into a series of C++ variable initializations:

<Latex formula="\begin{align*} a &= 5.3 \\ b &= \lceil a \rceil \\ c &= \frac{b}{1371} \end{align*}" inline={false}/>

### Problem 2

Convert the following mathematical equations into a series of C++ variable initializations:

<Latex formula="\begin{align*} x &= 7 \\ y &= x^{12} + 5 \\ z &= x \cdot y \end{align*}" inline={false}/>

Raising one integer to the power of another integer results in an integer. Similarly, the product of two integers is still an integer.

### Problem 3

Convert the following mathematical equations into a series of C++ variable initializations:

<Latex formula="\begin{align*} a &= 5.3 \\ b &= 12 \\ c &= \sqrt[b]{a} \\ d &= \log_a(b) + c \end{align*}" inline={false}/>
