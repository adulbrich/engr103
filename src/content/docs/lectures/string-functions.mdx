## Classes and Objects

The `std::string` type in C++ is not a primitive data type. Instead, it is a more complex type defined in the `<string>` header file, and it is known as a class.

A **class** is essentially a complex type that encapsulates both **data** and **behavior**. When you create an instance of a class (i.e., a variable of a class type), it is called an **object**. For example, in C++, strings are objects--they include both data (the text) and behavior (functions that act on the text).

When we say an object like a string “has” behavior, it means the object has functions associated with it. These functions, often called **member functions**, are tied to the specific object and operate on its data. This is different from global functions, which are standalone and operate only on the arguments passed to them.

An object is a **composite data type**, meaning it can include multiple pieces of data (called **member variables**) and multiple functions (**member functions**). In contrast, a primitive type (like int or bool) represents only a single value and has no associated behavior.

To access an object's members (variables or functions), you use the **dot operator** (`.`), formally known as the **member access operator**. The syntax is:

```cpp
<object>.<member>
```

Here, `<object>` is the name of your object (e.g., a string variable), and `<member>` is the specific member you want to access.

The `std::string` class has a member function called `size()`, which takes no arguments and returns the number of characters in the string. For a string variable named `my_string`, you can call this function as:

```cpp
my_string.size();
```

Each object, such as a string, has its own set of functions. For instance, if you have two strings, `my_string_1` and `my_string_2`, calling `my_string_1.size()` operates only on `my_string_1` and returns its length, while `my_string_2.size()` does the same for `my_string_2`. These functions are independent of each other and tied to their respective objects.

Here's an example program that uses `getline()` to read a sentence from the user and then prints the number of characters in the input:

```cpp
// string_size.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Enter a sentence: ";
    std::string sentence;
    std::getline(std::cin, sentence);
    std::cout << "The number of characters in your sentence is: "
              << sentence.size() << std::endl;
}
```

This is all you need to know about classes and objects for this course. 

## `std::string::size_type`

The `std::string` class provides many functions beyond `.size()`. Some of these functions, including `.size(),` use or return a special type called `std::string::size_type`.

The notation `std::string::size_type` uses two **scope resolution operators** (`::`). The first indicates the `std` namespace, while the second indicates a specific element within the `std::string` class. This entire construct, `std::string::size_type`, represents a data type, similar to `int`, `double`, or `std::string`.

Unlike `std::string`, `std::string::size_type` is not a class. It is usually an alias for a modified primitive integral type. This type is designed to store large values, such as the maximum possible number of characters in a string (often <Latex formula="2^{64} - 1"/> on modern systems). In contrast, an `int` may not have enough capacity to represent such large values, especially on some platforms.

The primary purpose of `std::string::size_type` is to handle values related to string size, character positions, and substrings. For smaller strings (fewer than <Latex formula="2^{31} - 1"/> characters), you could use an `int`, but it's generally better to use `std::string::size_type` to avoid potential issues like integer overflow and to maintain semantic clarity in your code.

```cpp
// string_size_type.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Enter a sentence: ";
    std::string sentence;
    std::getline(std::cin, sentence);

    // Store the length of the string in a variable of type std::string::size_type
    std::string::size_type length_of_sentence = sentence.size();

    // Print the value of the variable
    std::cout << "The number of characters in your sentence is: "
              << length_of_sentence << std::endl;
}
```
Using `std::string::size_typ`e ensures your program can handle extremely large strings if necessary and aligns the syntax with the intent of the code.

## Character Indices and the .at() Function

The `.at()` function is a useful feature of the `std::string` class. It takes a single argument of type `std::string::size_type`, representing the **index** (or position) of a character within the string. This function returns a `char`, which is the character at the specified index.

In C++, strings (and most other sequential containers) are **zero-indexed**. This means:

- The first character of a string is at index 0.
- The second character is at index 1.
- The third character is at index 2, and so on.

Consequently, the index of the last character in a string is always equal to the string's size (the number of characters) minus one.

Suppose you have a string variable named `my_string` and want to print its third character. You would use the `.at()` function like this:

```cpp
std::cout << my_string.at(2) << std::endl;
```

Here, the argument `2` specifies the third character since indices start at 0. Although the `.at()` function expects a `std::string::size_type` value, providing an `int` literal like `2` works because `int` values are implicitly convertible to `std::string::size_type`. However, converting in the opposite direction (from `std::string::size_type` to `int`) requires caution to avoid integer overflow, as `std::string::size_type` can represent larger values than `int`.

Imagine you want to check if a string contains a specific character and return `true` if it does, or `false` otherwise. While there is a built-in .`find()` function for this purpose (discussed later), let's write our own solution.

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Iterate over each character in the string.
2. Compare each character to the target character.
3. Return `true` if a match is found or `false` if the entire string is traversed without finding the character.

A `for` loop is ideal for this task because it naturally iterates over sequences. The loop initializes a counter at 0 (the first index) and increments it after each iteration until it reaches the size of the string. The counter serves as the index for accessing characters.

```cpp
// string_contains_character.cpp
bool string_contains_character(std::string the_string, char char_to_look_for) {
    // Loop through each character in the string
    for (std::string::size_type i = 0; i < the_string.size(); i++) {
        // Check if the current character matches the target
        if (the_string.at(i) == char_to_look_for) {
            return true; // Character found
        }
    }
    return false; // Character not found after traversing the string
}
```

The `.at()` function allows not only reading but also modifying a character at a specified index. You can use the assignment operator (`=`) with `.at()` to change a character. For example:

```cpp
my_string.at(4) = 'E';
```

This modifies the fifth character of `my_string`, changing it to `'E'`.

Previously, we stated that the assignment operator stores the value on the right-hand side in the variable on the left-hand side. Here, `.at()` returns a **reference** to the character at the given index, which allows the assignment operator to modify the character directly. References, like the second argument of `std::getline()`, enable modifying the original value.

You don't need to fully understand references yet--just know that this behavior works in specific contexts.

If you supply an index that is **out of bounds** (i.e., greater than or equal to the string's length), the `.at()` function will throw an exception. Since we haven't covered exception handling, this will crash your program with a **runtime error**. Avoid such mistakes by ensuring your indices are within bounds.

```cpp
// string_out_of_bounds.cpp
std::string my_string = "Hello, World!";
std::cout << my_string.at(0) << std::endl;  // Prints "H"
std::cout << my_string.at(12) << std::endl; // Prints "!"
std::cout << my_string.at(13) << std::endl; // Out-of-bounds! Runtime error.
```

```plaintext frame="terminal"
H
!
libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::out_of_range: basic_string
```

## Other String Functions

The `.size()` and `.at()` functions are just two of the many functions available in the `std::string` class. Together with others, they provide powerful tools for text processing. Below is a summary of some commonly used string functions and operators, assuming the availability of two string variables, `str` and `str2`, along with other arguments as needed:

| Member Function / Operator | Behavior |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| `str.size()` | Returns the number of characters in `str` as a `std::string::size_type` value. |
| `str.at(idx)` | `idx` is a `std::string::size_type` argument. Returns a reference to the character (`char` value) at the given index `idx` in `str`. |
| `str.find(query, start_idx)` | Searches for the string `query` within `str`, starting at index `start_idx` (optional, defaults to 0). Returns the index of the first occurrence of `query` as a `std::string::size_type` value or `std::string::npos` if `query` is not found. |
| `str.substr(start_idx, n_chars)` | Returns a substring of `str`, starting at index `start_idx` and containing `n_chars` characters. Both arguments are of type `std::string::size_type`. |
| `str.erase(start_idx, n_chars)` | Removes `n_chars` characters from `str`, starting at index `start_idx`. If `n_chars` is omitted, erases all characters from `start_idx` to the end of the string. |
| `str + str2` | Returns a new `std::string` object that concatenates `str` and `str2`. The `+=` operator can be used to append `str2` to `str` in place. |

While there are many more string functions and operators, mastering these will allow you to solve most basic text-processing problems.

Here's a program that demonstrates the use of these string functions:

```cpp
// string_functions.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string my_first_string = "The quick brown fox jumps";
    std::string my_second_string = " over the lazy dog.";

    // Concatenate strings
    std::string big_string = my_first_string + my_second_string;

    // Prints "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    std::cout << big_string << std::endl;

    // Prints the size of the string (44)
    std::cout << big_string.size() << std::endl;

    // Prints the character at index 7 ('c')
    std::cout << big_string.at(7) << std::endl;

    // Find the position of "fox"
    std::string::size_type pos = big_string.find("fox");
    if (pos == std::string::npos) {
        // This branch WILL NOT execute.
        std::cout << "Failed to find \"fox\" in big_string" << std::endl;
    } else {
        // Prints "16" (the index of "f" in "fox")
        std::cout << pos << std::endl;
    }

    // Find the position of "cat" (not present)
    pos = big_string.find("cat");
    if (pos == std::string::npos) {
        // This branch WILL execute.
        std::cout << "Failed to find \"cat\" in big_string" << std::endl;
    }

    // Extract and print a substring ("quick")
    std::cout << big_string.substr(4, 5) << std::endl;

    // Erase "quick " from the string
    big_string.erase(4, 6);

    // Prints the modified string: "The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    std::cout << big_string << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Below is the output you would see when running the program:

```plaintext frame="terminal"
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
44
c
16
Failed to find "cat" in big_string
quick
The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

By using these functions effectively, you can manipulate and analyze strings to handle a variety of text processing tasks.
