# ENGR 103: Engineering Computation and Algorithmic Thinking

## PDFs

To generate the documentation in PDF format, use [starlight-to-pdf](https://github.com/Linkerin/starlight-to-pdf).

Here's the command to generate one large PDF.

```bash
npx starlight-to-pdf https://engr103.alexulbrich.com/ --footer ./footer.html --header ./header.html --filename engr103 --no-contents --margins '2cm 1cm 2cm 1cm'
```

To generate lecture notes in separate files (one per page), use the corresponding bash script (also for practicalities, assignments):

```bash
cd pdf
chmod +x ./generate-lecture-notes.sh
./generate-lecture-notes.sh
```

To generate slides from `marp`, use:

```bash
cd slides
npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest web-graphics.md --pdf --allow-local-files
```

## Parking

- [ ] Add learning objectives to each lecture, optionally studios and assignments as well
- [ ] Improve the "secondary" learning outcomes for the class (to be more programming specific)
- [ ] Remove latex files: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2004024/how-to-permanently-delete-a-file-stored-in-git
- [ ] Add visual explanations of memory allocation and references
- [ ] Refactor assignment 3 (clearer instructions OR smaller assignment) -- feedback is that it's more complicated than other assignments
- [ ] Mention using `getline()` in dictionary assignment instead of `cin`
- [ ] Provide larger code examples/programs the students can play with
- [ ] Use [Internationalization](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) to have multiple version of the course for different terms or different languages.
- [ ] Change the icon for the language dropdown (code instead of translation)
- [ ] Figure out the CSS for the Latex component. Right now, the containing `<span>` has some padding on the right which looks odd when there's punctuation following the expression.

Here's an example of the change to be made to `astro.config.mjs` to enable different versions:

```js
defaultLocale: 'root',
locales: {
  root: {
    label: 'C++',
    lang: 'cpp', 
  },
  'py': {
    label: 'Python',
    lang: 'py',
  },
},
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal.

This project uses `bun` instead of `npm`.

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
